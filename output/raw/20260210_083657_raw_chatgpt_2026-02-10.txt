{"executive_summary":"Market developments across Lloyd's, global specialty carriers and broker platforms point to three near-term priorities for C-suite and senior consultants: accelerate pragmatic digitisation of placement and payment flows, reinforce claims and exposure disciplines amid rising fraud and complex perils, and recalibrate distribution and capital strategies as strategic investments and talent moves reshape competitive dynamics. Actions should focus on targeted platform integrations, strengthening claims governance aligned to Lloyd's new hurdle principle, and proactive partnership strategies with capital providers and fintech payment partners.","themes":["Digitisation and placement platform urgency","Claims governance and fraud control (Lloyd's hurdle principle)","Exposure management and emerging risks (climate, cyber, supply chain)","Distribution evolution: brokers, MGAs and premium finance integrations","Capital allocation and strategic minority investments"],"items":[{"id":"13171c7c8ac673d3d3582cc2ab67c469a39be4aa5d076327b286d7b43e65fe97","why":"Broker-premium finance integration signals distribution-led growth and a pragmatic route to improve conversion and retention;
