{"executive_summary":"Current market signals underscore accelerated broker geographic expansion, intensified competition from regional carriers, and material shifts in specialty pricing and distribution. Lloyd's syndicates and global specialty brokers should prioritize partnerships with expanding broking houses and placement platforms, reassess exposures in cyber and casualty lines, and incorporate mounting regulatory and talent risks into underwriting and distribution strategies. InsurTech funding and targeted sector demand (notably data centers and medical liability) offer selective capacity deployment and platform-integration opportunities.","themes":["Broker geographic
