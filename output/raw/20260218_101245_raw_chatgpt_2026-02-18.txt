{"executive_summary":"Recent global developments underscore accelerating pressure on Lloyd’s, specialty carriers, brokers, syndicates and placement platforms from legacy mass-tort litigation, expanding SRCC and climate-driven catastrophe exposures, rapid shifts in distribution via AI and marketplaces, and continued influx of alternative capital into insurance-linked products. Marine sanction avoidance, product-contamination episodes and supply‑chain technology shocks further complicate underwriting and placement workflows. Strategic priorities for market leaders are: reinforce underwriting discipline and wording clarity for long‑tail and political-risk exposures; accelerate data, AI and platform integration across distribution and claims; and actively manage capital mixes amid tightening ILS premia and cyber M&A activity.","themes":["Legacy mass‑tort and product liability risk","Political violence / SRCC and urban catastrophe exposure","Climate adaptation, floods and infrastructure risk","Cyber market consolidation and cyber capacity dynamics","Distribution disruption: AI, marketplaces and conversational channels","Alternative capital and ILS dynamics","Sanctions, shadow fleet and marine underwriting risk"],"items":[{"id":"2b4cc53afa63c256f24186b1903044580917c318170306411a1a03084ee9447d","why":"Continued plaintiff success in talc litigation reinforces persistent long‑tail casualty exposures that drive reserve volatility, allocation disputes and reinsurance contagion for product liability portfolios.","bullets":["Reassess aggregate exposures and reserve adequacy across syndicates writing legacy product liability;
