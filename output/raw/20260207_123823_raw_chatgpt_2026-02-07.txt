{"executive_summary":"Recent global headlines signal elevated geopolitical, terrorism and supply-chain exposures that directly affect Lloyd's, global specialty brokers, syndicates and placement platforms. Houthi activity around Yemen and Red Sea shipping lanes is driving war/terror premiums, capacity displacement and urgent wording reviews for marine, cargo and energy accounts. Russian political dynamics sustain sanctions, secondary-liability and cyber/energy underwriting uncertainty. Terrorist incidents (suicide bombings) sustain appetite for political violence and terrorism products. Separately, food & drink and manufacturing sector pressures—supply-chain disruption, contamination risk and recalls—are increasing product liability, contingent business interruption and cargo exposure. Brokers and platforms must act now to reassess aggregation, update wordings, enhance sanctions screening and route placements to capital with explicit appetite and real-time intelligence.","themes":["Maritime/war risk and Red Sea disruption","Sanctions, secondary exposure and energy/cyber risk from Russia","Terrorism & political violence — event frequency and standalone
