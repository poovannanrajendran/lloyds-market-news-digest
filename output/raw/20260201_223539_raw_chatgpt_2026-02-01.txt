{"executive_summary":"Near-term market dynamics for Lloyd's, global specialty insurers, syndicates and brokers are dominated by two converging structural trends: (1) rapid growth in data-centre and AI-related exposures creating a major underwriting and capacity opportunity, and (2) continued dislocation in cyber and catastrophe markets driven by capacity supply, pricing compression and innovation in risk transfer (parametric and treaty-level solutions). Brokers and placement platforms remain primary vectors for product innovation and market access — designing bespoke treaties, aggregating capacity and partnering with MGAs and syndicates. Executives should prioritise capability build (data-driven underwriting, claims, and placement tech), selective capital allocation to hyperscale/AI risks, and disciplined cyber portfolio management to navigate a buyers’ market while capturing new revenue streams.","themes":["Data-centre and AI infrastructure as a strategic market opportunity","Cyber pricing dislocation and capacity
