{"executive_summary":"Current market signals point to accelerated technology adoption, distribution expansion and structural capital shifts across the Lloyd's and global specialty ecosystem. AI and data partnerships are moving from experimentation to production, informing underwriting, broker advisory and placement precision. Cyber continues to surface as a primary exposure with demand for consistent quantification tools that brokers and syndicates must integrate into placement workflows. Private capital is consolidating opportunity in MGAs and technology-enabled underwriting platforms, while jurisdictional growth (Cayman, GIFT City) and parametric solutions are reshaping capacity sourcing and sovereign/humanitarian programmes. For C-suite and senior advisors the priorities are: embed data & model governance, align distribution strategy with platform partners, de-risk cyber through analytics and placement standards, and reposition capital deployment for specialty growth and parametric instruments.","themes":["AI and data-driven underwriting","Cyber risk quantification and broking enablement","MGA growth and private
