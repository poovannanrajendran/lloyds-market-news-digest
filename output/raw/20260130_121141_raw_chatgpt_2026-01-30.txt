{"executive_summary":"Current global and regional headlines — from intensified US-Russia/US-Ukraine tensions and continuing instability in Venezuela/Cuba to domestic UK crime trends and sector pressures on hospitality — have direct implications for Lloyd's, global specialty carriers, brokers, syndicates and placement platforms. Key priorities for the market are recalibrating war/terror and political-risk appetites, ensuring sanctions and regulatory compliance, managing placement friction during US government disruptions, and protecting retail and SME portfolios (hospitality, leisure, regional marine). Brokers and placement platforms must reinforce screening, KYC and clause hygiene while syndicates should proactively stress-test exposures, refine underwriting terms and engage clients on risk mitigation to preserve capital and maintain placement efficiency.","themes":["Geopolitical conflict & elevated war risk","Sanctions, export controls and regulatory compliance","Government operational
