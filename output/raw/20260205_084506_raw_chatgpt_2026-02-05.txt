{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA activity highlights two concurrent priorities for the Lloyd’s and global specialty ecosystem: heightened detection and public warning of unauthorised firms (which elevates distribution and reputational risk for brokers, syndicates and placement platforms), and a clear regulatory agenda that both supports scaled innovation and tightens conduct oversight. Multiple FCA warnings about unauthorised entities underline the need for immediate enhancements in onboarding, platform controls and counterparty verification. Parallel FCA initiatives — a Scale-up Unit, public speeches on insurance innovation, and robust enforcement actions — signal opportunities for compliant growth but also an intensified supervisory and enforcement environment. C-suite and market leadership should treat these developments as a call to reinforce governance, client protection, connectivity with regulated partners and real‑time monitoring across placement channels.","themes":["Unauthorised intermediaries and fraud risk in distribution chains","Broker and syndicate onboarding, KYC and counterparty verification","Placement platform integrity and
