{"executive_summary":"Recent industry reporting underscores accelerating technology-led change, intensified product innovation around cyber/AI exposures, and continued friction in talent and distribution across specialty markets. For Lloyd's syndicates, global specialty carriers and placement platforms, priorities are: calibrating AI deployment while retaining senior underwriting oversight; adapting product architecture to combined cyber/tech/AI liabilities; managing capacity and pricing signals from improved underwriting performance; and protecting distribution value amid recruitment and legal disputes. Risk engineering, digital placement integration and stronger documentation will be decisive for market participants.","themes":["AI adoption and human oversight in underwriting and claims","Product
