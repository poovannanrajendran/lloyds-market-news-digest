{"executive_summary":"The Lloyd's and global specialty insurance ecosystem enters 2026 with sustained E&S growth tempered by pockets of recalibration across casualty and property. Syndicates, brokers and placement platforms face intensified competition as MGUs, delegated authority and third‑party capital scale rapidly; technology and parametric solutions are migrating from niche to core product sets. C-suite priorities should be: protect underwriting discipline while selectively pursuing scale, accelerate data and placement‑platform integration, formalize governance for delegated models, and expand cyber and parametric capabilities to meet evolving client demand.","themes":["E&S expansion vs. recalibration","Delegated underwriting and MGU/platform scale","Property and construction program
