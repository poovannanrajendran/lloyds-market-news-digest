{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA warnings and publications underline two immediate priorities for Lloyd's market stakeholders: (1) elevated fraud and unauthorised-entity risk across distribution channels, which directly threatens broker, syndicate and placement-platform integrity; and (2) regulatory and technology developments — notably the FCA's stablecoin sandbox and supervisory communications — that will materially affect premium settlement, cross-border placements and compliance expectations. Managing agents, brokers and platform operators must sharpen intake and onboarding controls, reinforce payment and settlement due diligence, and proactively engage with FCA consultations and regulatory priorities to protect capital, reputation and distribution continuity.","themes":["Fraud & unauthorised operators targeting brokers and clients","Payments & settlement innovation
