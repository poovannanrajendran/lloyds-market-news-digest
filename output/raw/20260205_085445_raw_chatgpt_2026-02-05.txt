{"executive_summary":"Recent industry developments underscore continued structural change across global specialty markets: cedents are consolidating reinsurer panels, pricing remains competitive at major renewals, and brokers and regional specialists are expanding capability to capture cross-border business. Talent and leadership moves — from Bermuda to Japan and Romania — are accelerating operational and underwriting sophistication, while cyber regulatory risk is emerging as an uninsurable threat requiring new placement approaches. For Lloyd’s syndicates, global reinsurers and placement platforms, the combination of concentrated panels, product specialization (aviation, affinity, PRT) and regulatory complexity creates both opportunity and execution risk: brokers must refine placement strategies and syndicates must demonstrate differentiated capacity, wordings and service to retain core relationships.","themes":["Panel
