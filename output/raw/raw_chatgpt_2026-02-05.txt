{"executive_summary":"January–February signals confirm a structural re‑rating of the London and global specialty markets toward alternative capital, capital‑efficient Lloyd's access and product-led differentiation. Cat bonds, private ILS, retrocession compression and investor-led M&A are reshaping how brokers source capacity and how syndicates deploy capital and manage appetites. C-suite priorities are clear: integrate ILS channels into placement platforms, harden underwriting and analytics for catastrophe, cyber and supply‑chain exposures, and shore up distribution and delegated authority frameworks to retain lead capacity and protect margins."]}
