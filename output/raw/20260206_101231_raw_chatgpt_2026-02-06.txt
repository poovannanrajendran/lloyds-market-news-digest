{"executive_summary":"Across the Lloyd's and global specialty ecosystem the reporting highlights four immediate priorities for C-suite and senior placement teams: (1) AI-driven exposures are emerging as a distinct risk class that strains existing policy triggers and requires new wordings, risk taxonomy and capacity allocation; (2) declining risk‑adjusted pricing at recent reinsurance renewals underscores competitive pressure and the need for disciplined risk selection by syndicates and brokers; (3) data confidence and explainability of AI models are material to underwriting decisions and will drive demand for stronger data governance, vendor due diligence and enhanced placement‑platform integrations; (4) rising political violence is manifesting as increased business interruption losses, pressuring cover wordings, aggregation management and treaty terms. Recommended focus areas: accelerate product and wording evolution for probabilistic/AI exposures; elevate data and model governance into underwriting decision‑making; reinforce portfolio diversification and collateralised solutions to counter pricing compression; and tighten PV/BI exposures through granular risk assessment, exclusions and placement platform scenario testing.","themes":["AI risk taxonomy and coverage triggers","Data confidence, explainability and vendor governance","Pricing pressure and capacity dynamics at renewals","Political violence and rising business interruption exposures","Placement platform integration for evidence, modelling and wordings"],"items":[{"id":"6d7c48d4109240c5e1a7c9bf70dfb2f9779386e880f6e83c0d41b3c0a3f3254b","why":"Lockton Re and Armilla signal that AI introduces probabilistic failure modes that do not fit traditional indemnity triggers.
