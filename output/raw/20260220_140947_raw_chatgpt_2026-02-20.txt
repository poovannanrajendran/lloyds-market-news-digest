{"executive_summary":"Current signals indicate continued pressure on global specialty capacity and distribution strategies across Lloyd’s, syndicates and broker markets. Soft reinsurance pricing and capital efficiency debates are prompting incumbents to reconsider reinsurance purchases and capital deployment. Simultaneously, strategic M&A and new capital into MGAs/insurtech are reshaping placement workflows and broker negotiating leverage. Litigation funding and emerging telematics-driven underwriting dynamics will influence claims volatility and appetite, driving greater emphasis on disciplined underwriting, platform integration and proactive placement governance.","themes":["Soft reinsurance market and capacity management","M&A and strategic capital shifts in global specialty","Insurtech/MGA capital raising and placement platform integration","Regulatory and litigation tail risks affecting claims volatility"],"items":[{"id":"5c7631a3447b27b04125a1cb531da6278845e7e08e2dfedd473a387cbda3a263","why":"Suncorp considering additional reinsurance is a direct indicator of how primary carriers respond to soft market pricing—relevant to syndicate capacity decisions and broker negotiation strategies.","bullets":["Signals carriers may opportunistically buy capacity rather than rely solely on lower rates;
