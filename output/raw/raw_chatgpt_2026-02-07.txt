{"executive_summary":"This set of market updates signals continued strategic repositioning across global specialty and distribution channels with direct implications for the Lloyd's market, syndicates, brokers and placement platforms. Key trends include re-platforming and technology rationalization at Lloyd's, accelerated growth of MGAs and program managers driving aggregation of specialty capacity, ongoing M&A and private capital injections into broker and agency networks, and regulatory and litigation outcomes shaping reinsurance and claims recoveries. For C-suite and consultants, priorities are: accelerate platform interoperability and data migration planning for Lloyd's re-platforming, reassess capital and retro strategies in light of court recoveries and large insured losses, fortify placement and delegated authority governance as MGAs scale, and align talent and distribution M&A to secure specialty lines and renewal pipelines.","themes":["Lloyd's re-platforming and technology strategy","MGA and program model expansion","Capacity, reinsurance and court-driven recoveries","Brokerage and agency consolidation with
