{"executive_summary":"Heightened geopolitical volatility (Russia/Ukraine, US-Russia, US/Ukraine, Venezuela/Cuba) combined with US domestic political risk (DHS funding and potential government shutdowns) materially increases underwriting, sanction-compliance and placement operational risk for the Lloyd’s and global specialty community. Syndicates and brokers should prioritise: (1) rapid sanction screening and KYC upgrades across placement platforms; (2) reassessment of war/terror, political violence and cyber exposures and corresponding wordings/exclusions; (3) stress-testing treaty and collateral arrangements for prolonged disruption; and (4) targeted client advisory on business continuity and loss mitigation for exposed classes (marine, energy, defence supply chain, UK leisure and event sectors). These developments create selective capacity opportunities for specialist underwriters but require disciplined underwriting, tightened policy conditions and enhanced broker diligence.","themes":["Geopolitical & kinetic risk (Russia/Ukraine, US-Russia, US/Ukraine)","Sanctions, embargoes and regulatory compliance (US, Caribbean, Latin America)","War, political violence & cyber escalation modelling","Operational resilience and platform compliance for brokers and placements","Specialty exposure pressure: marine, energy, defence supply chain, kidnap & ransom, event and leisure","Underwriting discipline: wording, exclusions, pricing and reinsurance capacity"],"items":[{"id":"aed14fd7ada20947721a6989062f9a76381324b7ee30e6c51d9e37cf0b2f6769","why":"Department of Homeland Security funding and policy shifts affect US critical‑infrastructure resilience, incident response coordination and border security — all of which influence cyber, terrorism and contingent business interruption exposures underwritten by Lloyd’s syndicates.","bullets":["Assess implications of DHS funding variability on federal incident response times and adjust cyber underwriting scenarios and response SLAs accordingly.","Ensure placement platforms and brokers enforce DHS‑aligned sanctions/screening lists and threat intel feeds for US exposures.","Engage clients on resilience investments (OT/IT segmentation, supply chain continuity) that reduce potential BI and contingent liability claims."]},{"id":"237ff0fd63fce37ce2151cd3a6239cdadf04cb2a15d9e44c478301eafcd2b651","why":"US government shutdown risk disrupts regulators, federal services and data flows;
