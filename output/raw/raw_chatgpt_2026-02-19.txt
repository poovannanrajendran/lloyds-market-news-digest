[{"executive_summary":"J.P. Morgan’s 2026 e‑Trading findings mandate a strategic reset for Lloyd’s, global specialty brokers, syndicates and placement platforms: electronic placement, real‑time data and standardised protocols must be treated as core risk‑management and revenue infrastructure. Elevated conduct and fraud risks—from clone firms to crypto‑branded platforms—require urgent tightening of third‑party onboarding, premium‑flow verification and proactive regulatory engagement. Talent‑led distribution moves (notably A&H) and aggregation threats (SRCC/civil‑unrest) compel accelerated platform interoperability, AI‑driven underwriting signals, stronger delegated‑authority controls and selective repricing to protect capacity and market reputation."}]}
