{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA warnings and policy outputs underline three concurrent priorities for the Lloyd's and global specialty community: counterparty and platform integrity (unauthorised firms and scams), payments modernisation and operational resilience, and intensified fair value and premium finance scrutiny. Brokers, managing agents, syndicates and placement platforms should treat these signals as operational and conduct imperatives — strengthen onboarding and ongoing due diligence, adapt placement and settlement workflows for faster, transparent payments, and revalidate remuneration, premium finance and product design against fair value expectations. Active engagement with regulators and accelerated investment in platform controls and reconciliation capabilities will reduce contagion from unauthorised operators and ensure compliance as market payments and consumer duty regimes evolve.","themes":["Unauthorised firms and counterparty risk","Payments modernisation, settlement and operational resilience","Fair value, premium finance and distribution remuneration transparency"],"items":[{"id":"9a7f639fca850b2698e8684687f8ca6efebc88b5ea7d1976325ebcbc01923abf","why":"FCA warning on an unauthorised firm highlights the exposure of brokers, syndicates and placement platforms to fraud and impersonation in the placement chain.","bullets":["Brokers and Lloyd’s coverholders must enhance onboarding checks and directory verification to prevent fraudulent counterparties from accessing slips or placement workflows.","Placement platforms should segment and harden API and connectivity controls to reduce the risk of unauthorised actors exploiting electronic submission or premium payment channels.","Commercial and operational agreements must stipulate escrow, segregation of client funds and audit rights, recognising that clients transacting with unauthorised firms forfeit FSCS and FOS protections."]},{"id":"496db24c650c7a3420caf21f9e60d6b314bfe39b508770d5fa2db049b925f3cd","why":"The FCA warning on AutoBaseTrade signals persistent targeting of the UK market by unauthorised intermediaries, with specific consequences for placement flows and motor-related specialty business.","bullets":["Motor and niche specialty lines frequently rely on third-party intermediaries;
