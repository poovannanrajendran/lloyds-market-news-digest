{"executive_summary":"Early 2026 commentary across E&S and specialty markets underscores a transition from prolonged hard-market conditions to selective growth driven by new capacity models, technology adoption, and product innovation. Brokers and MGAs are scaling programs and leveraging placement platforms; delegated underwriting and third‑party capital are structurally changing how specialty risk is distributed. Lloyd’s syndicates and global specialty carriers face a dual mandate: selectively pursue profitable E&S property and construction opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline in casualty and catastrophe-exposed lines. Technology (AI, data orchestration, parametrics) and cyber threat activity are prioritised as enablers and loss drivers respectively, and reinsurance/capital dynamics remain a critical constraint on growth and capacity allocation.","themes":["E&S growth and product diversification","Delegated underwriting, MGUs and third‑party capital","Placement platforms and syndicate capacity
