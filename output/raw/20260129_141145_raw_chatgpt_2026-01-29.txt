Regulatory headwinds tied to legacy Covid BI litigation and evolving physical risk drivers such as commercial solar PV fires create balance-sheet uncertainty that requires active portfolio management and strengthened risk engineering and claims strategies.","themes":["MGA growth and delegated authority","Broker consolidation and offshore expansion","Specialty product innovation (cyber, event,
