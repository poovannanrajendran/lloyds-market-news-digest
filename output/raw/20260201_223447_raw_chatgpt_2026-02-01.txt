{"executive_summary":"The selected Reinsurance News items point to three strategic imperatives for Lloyd’s market participants and global specialty brokers: accelerate capability build‑out for data‑centre and AI-related risks; adapt to volatile cyber pricing driven by capacity imbalances; and leverage broker-led innovation and platform partnerships to capture new risk transfer opportunities. Syndicates should prioritise specialist treaty design, data‑driven underwriting partnerships with MGAs, and parametric/speed‑to‑pay solutions for sovereign and catastrophe response. Brokers and placement platforms must capitalise on market distribution strengths, talent investments and transaction liability demand as private credit and M&A activity reshape coverage needs.","themes":["Data‑centre & AI risk opportunity","Cyber pricing and capacity dynamics","Broker innovation and global practice consolidation","Buyers' market / pricing pressure into
