{"executive_summary":"Heightened geopolitical tensions across the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, combined with persistent maritime security threats and episodic public-health events, are concentrating material risk for Lloyd’s market participants and global specialty brokers. Syndicates and placement platforms should anticipate constrained capacity, tighter wordings on war/political violence and sanctions, and operational strain from enhanced compliance and claims activity. Immediate priorities: review war/terror and infectious-disease exclusions, reinforce sanctions screening and documentation, and engage reinsurance and capacity partners to maintain continuity for core clients and large-event programmes.","themes":["Geopolitical risk and sanctions impact on underwriting and capacity","Marine and offshore security / war risk exposure","Political violence, kidnap & ransom and terrorism cover implications","Regulatory and compliance pressure for UK-based marketplaces and brokers","Infectious disease and event-contingent insurance stress","Placement platform and syndicate capacity management"],"items":[{"id":"e6f224a699bf275698cca4ca45d3a4d5b6229d2a5eb34afee1c53be2b8a9f66a","why":"Escalation in the West Bank increases political violence and terrorism exposure for property, kidnap & ransom and political risk lines, complicating placement and sanctions-sensitive underwriting for Lloyd’s syndicates.","bullets":["Elevated claims risk across property, political violence and contingent business interruption for clients with operations or supply chains in the occupied territories.","Underwriting friction: tighter war/terror wordings, higher premiums and potential capacity withdrawal by syndicates on affected risks.","Operational imperative for brokers and platforms to verify sanctions exposure, enhanced origin-of-risk due diligence and document transactional approvals for Lloyd’s market submissions."]},{"id":"7c95d6d4f3dc9da95e055799ec00cd160b19e467eb565551368111ad3943aaac","why":"Ongoing Eastern Europe tensions, notably spill-over from Russia/Ukraine dynamics, drive sustained demand for political-risk, cyber and energy liability covers while pressuring capacity and reinsurance terms for Lloyd’s and global specialty markets.","bullets":["Increased attritional and catastrophic exposures for energy, infrastructure and aerospace/defence programmes with potential for rising treaty retentions and reduced facultative capacity.","Sanctions and market access challenges necessitate tight counterparty screening and bespoke broker wording to manage aggregation and contagion across portfolios.","Placement platforms must prepare for accelerated premium resets, stricter treaty exclusions and proactive reinsurance procurement to stabilise syndicate capacity."]},{"id":"85eb9cfc4db262cad5b73832559dca2aebdce23cfeafa4d5df7ba3d6fc8ea5dd","why":"Indian Ocean developments heighten maritime, cargo and offshore energy risks (including piracy and transit disruption), affecting hull & machinery, war risks and marine cargo lines prominent in Lloyd’s books.","bullets":["Direct impact on premiums and deductibles for hull, cargo and offshore energy covers as transits shift and rerouting increases voyage costs and delivery delays.","War/strikes/piracy clauses will be re-evaluated;
