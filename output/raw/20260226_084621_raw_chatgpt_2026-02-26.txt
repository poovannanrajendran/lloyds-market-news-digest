{"executive_summary":"Market signals across these items point to sustained capacity in global reinsurance, targeted growth in specialty underwriting, and accelerating shifts in distribution and placement models. Reinsurer earnings and large insurer-led programs underpin available capital, while MGAs, parametric solutions and broker leadership moves are reshaping how risk is packaged and placed. For Lloyd's executives, syndicate chiefs and placement-platform strategists, priorities are: calibrating appetite against improved reinsurer results, accelerating partnerships with technology-driven MGAs and platforms, and reassessing counterparty and claims dynamics as leadership and product innovation evolve.","themes":["Reinsurance capacity and profitability","Distribution transformation: MGAs
