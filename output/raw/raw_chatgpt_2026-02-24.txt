{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA enforcement over unauthorised firms and influencer-driven financial promotions exposes Lloyd’s, global specialty carriers, brokers, syndicates and placement platforms to immediate operational, regulatory and reputational risk. Priorities are clear: tighten intermediary onboarding and continuous due diligence, enforce strict premium‑handling and escrow controls in delegated authority, and deploy active domain, influencer and platform monitoring with rapid takedown and regulatory reporting. Concurrent structural shifts — accelerating digital distribution, alternative capital (ILS) growth and AI‑related claims — demand urgent updates to wordings, capital modelling and placement workflows. Executive focus must be rapid remediation, targeted tech investment and disciplined counterparty governance."]}
