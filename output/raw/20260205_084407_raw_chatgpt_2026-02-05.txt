{"executive_summary":"Regulatory signals from the FCA and allied bodies in this set of notices highlight two concurrent themes material to the Lloyd's and global specialty ecosystem: (1) amplified enforcement and consumer-protection activity targeting unauthorised firms and market misconduct, and (2) calibrated regulatory support for scaled innovation. Multiple FCA warnings about unauthorised trading entities increase counterparty, distribution and placement risk for brokers, syndicates and electronic placement platforms. High-profile enforcement (Banque Havilland) underscores intensified scrutiny of market conduct and integrity. Simultaneously, the Scale-up Unit and senior FCA messaging on insurance innovation signal opportunities for InsurTechs and platforms to scale — provided governance, transparency and consumer outcome controls are robust. For C-suite and senior insurance consultants the near-term priorities are: tighten onboarding and platform controls to exclude unauthorised actors; reassess counterparty and conduct risk frameworks; engage proactively with regulators when scaling digital placement or distribution capabilities; and embed clear client-representation and fee governance across broker and claims workflows.","themes":["Unauthorised intermediaries and distribution risk","Market integrity and enforcement risk","Regulatory support for InsurTech and scale-ups","Operational controls for placement platforms and brokers","Client representation, fee governance and consumer protection"],"items":[{"id":"7f627218f7c5cbbf223f3c61b4cb1319722edbcb42339e97c575100509aad9bd","why":"FCA warning flags an unauthorised entity potentially targeting UK investors;
