{"executive_summary":"Select Reinsurance News items signal measurable implications for the Lloyd's and global specialty marketplace: improved carrier profitability and reinsurer results are increasing available capacity and exerting downward pressure on hard-market pricing; leadership moves at major brokers, reinsurers and specialty carriers will reshape placement flows and platform strategies; innovation in parametric and insurance-backed credit solutions presents distribution and syndicate underwriting opportunities in emerging and underserved markets; and pension buy-ins and rating actions underscore counterparty and longevity risks that syndicates, brokers and placement platforms must manage proactively. Brokers and syndicates should prioritise counterparty diligence, capital-efficient product design, and platform integration to capture growth while protecting reinsurance recoverables and balance-sheet volatility.","themes":["Carrier profitability and capacity dynamics","Talent and broker governance reshaping placement flows","Parametric and tech-enabled distribution
