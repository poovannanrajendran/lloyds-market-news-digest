{"executive_summary":"The curated set of Reinsurance News items signals three immediate priorities for Lloyd’s market participants, global specialty carriers, brokers, syndicates and placement platforms: (1) rapid commercialisation of digital infrastructure and AI-related exposures (data centres and AI-enabled operations) demanding bespoke treaty and facultative solutions; (2) continued dislocation in cyber pricing and capacity that requires active portfolio management, data-driven underwriting and MGA/syndicate partnerships; and (3) broker-led product and placement innovation — from transaction liability scale-ups to the first data‑centre treaty and parametric sovereign response — which will shape capacity allocation, wordings and placement workflows through 2026. Executives should prioritise capacity strategy, underwriting data infrastructure, close collaboration with distribution partners and accelerated development of tailored coverages and placement technology to capture these opportunities while managing accumulation and correlation risks.","themes":["Data centres & AI-driven risk opportunity","Cyber capacity, pricing and aggregation management","Broker-led product innovation and global practice scale","Lloyd's syndicate and reinsurer partnerships with MGAs and platforms","Parametric and alternative risk transfer acceleration","Market cycle implications: buyers' market and capital allocation"],"items":[{"id":"55ffaa82e5a015fdecd412b8e24b04ab2ef4884f685000bafe54d5a4f7a0921f","why":"Aggregate coverage of AI in insurance highlights the strategic imperative to develop underwriting frameworks, products and placement processes for AI-driven exposures, especially as insurers and reinsurers engage with digital infrastructure and data-centre risks.","bullets":["Underwriting: need for AI-specific modelling, scenario analysis and data feeds to underwrite AI operational and technology failure exposures.","Productisation: opportunity to develop tailored AI/systemic tech covers and exclusions;
