{"executive_summary":"Market signals from early February 2026 indicate a Lloyd's-centric redistribution of specialty capacity, continued product innovation in tech and cyber, and evolving risk drivers in climate, AI and casualty severity. Notable market actions — a program manager switching exclusively to Lloyd's backing, reinsurers identifying targeted property catastrophe opportunities, and brokers/reinsurers publishing risk intelligence on ransomware and AI — underscore the need for syndicates, brokers and placement platforms to accelerate capability alignment: deepen Lloyd's engagement where rated capacity is critical, standardise climate and AI risk frameworks for underwriting, and adapt cyber/privacy offerings to shifting loss patterns. C-suite priorities should be: secure differentiated Lloyd's capacity and distribution partnerships, invest in underwriting analytics for climate/AI/cyber, and optimise placement platform integrations to enable rapid, compliant access to highly rated paper.","themes":["Lloyd's strategic capacity and distribution shift","Climate and sustainability integration into underwriting","Cyber risk
