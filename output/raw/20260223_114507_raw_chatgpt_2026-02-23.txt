{"executive_summary":"Recent commercial-insurance developments reinforce three priorities for Lloyd’s, global specialty carriers, syndicates and brokers: active management of legacy and emerging liability exposures, adaptation to alternative capital and captive growth, and reinforcement of governance and placement integrity. Significant court rulings and large settlements underline elevated litigation and catastrophe risk that can constrain capacity and pricing. Brokers and placement platforms must reinforce compliance, documentation and client advisory capabilities to defend market reputation and preserve access to global specialty capital. Strategic actions should include targeted portfolio reviews, refined catastrophe aggregation models, enhanced underwriting of product-liability and auto technologies, and proactive engagement with captive sponsors and placement technology providers.","themes":["Litigation and legacy liability management","Catastrophe exposure and climate-driven settlements","Alternative capital and captive
