{"executive_summary":"Recent signals across the specialty insurance ecosystem point to a continued focus on capacity management, strategic consolidation, and distribution innovation. Primary themes include reinsurer and carrier responses to a soft market, M&A activity reshaping global specialty capacity, the rise of capital-backed insurtechs and MGAs putting pressure on placement platforms and brokers, and persistent regulatory and litigation headwinds that affect pricing and underwriting strategy. For Lloyd’s and syndicates, the imperative is clear: manage capital allocation and reinsurance strategies prudently, accelerate platform and data investments to defend placement share, and maintain proactive engagement with brokers and regulators to mitigate legal and social risk exposures.","themes":["Capacity & reinsurance strategy","Consolidation and capital shifts in global
