{"executive_summary":"Recent market intelligence highlights a concentrated shift in the London and global specialty ecosystem: MGAs are scaling and integrating into London access points and broker systems; Lloyd's is operationalising claims as a formal regulatory ‘hurdle’ with cascading implications for syndicates and service partners; cyber risk — including targeted attacks on major events — and advanced cyber modelling remain central to capacity decisions; placement platforms and real‑time parametric technology are accelerating distribution efficiency; and talent, M&A economics and AI/automation are reshaping broker and underwriting operating models. C-suite priorities should be: align capital allocation to scaled, disciplined MGAs and cyber analytics; accelerate platform connectivity (imarket/Open GI, Blink Parametric) to retain broker relationships; upgrade claims capabilities to meet Lloyd’s new expectations; and embed AI and people strategies to protect and enhance market share.","themes":["MGA scale and London market
