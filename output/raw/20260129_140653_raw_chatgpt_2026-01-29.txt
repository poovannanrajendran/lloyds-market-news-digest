{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA activity and statements signal intensified focus on market integrity, consumer protection and enforcement that directly affect Lloyd’s market participants, global specialty brokers, syndicates and placement platforms. Heightened warnings about unauthorised and clone firms, public awareness campaigns and cross-agency action on crypto-assets increase counterparty and distribution risk; simultaneously FCA consultations on the protection gap and ongoing Consumer Duty implementation will pressure product governance, distribution practices and platform onboarding. Senior risk, legal and placement teams should prioritise remediation of onboarding controls, sanction/crypto screening, delegated authority verification and active engagement with FCA policy workstreams.","themes":["Market integrity and fraud risk (unauthorised firms, clone firms)","Regulatory enforcement and cross‑agency sanctions/crypto controls","Consumer protection and distribution governance (Consumer Duty, protection gap)","Operational resilience of placement platforms and broker onboarding","Delegated authority, appointed representatives and reputational risk management","Proactive regulatory engagement and surveillance tooling adoption"],"items":[{"id":"fd8a73310a7f70f56e667b27dd931981a48fb3b5515397518760952e6c2b5980","why":"FCA warning on 'Authentic Global Trade' highlights persistent unauthorised market actors that can compromise placements, premium flows and client protection across cross‑border specialty business.","bullets":["Immediate action: incorporate the FCA Warning List into automated onboarding and pre‑bind counterparty checks on platforms and broker workflows.","Distribution risk: treat unsolicited counterparties as heightened risk for syndicate placements and require enhanced proof of regulatory standing and third‑party references.","Client protection: update client advisories and transaction confirmations to state the firm checks completed and the limits of FSCS/FOS protections for unauthorised entities."]},{"id":"6c0363a8345610316547abf88dea3c3103d722e92b1b3764c16803c0152cc005","why":"Warning on 'Global‑XMarkets' demonstrates continued targeting of UK market participants, amplifying the need for brokers and syndicates to verify intermediary credentials and payment routing legitimacy.","bullets":["Operational control: mandate verification of FCA authorisation numbers and beneficial ownership before accepting new brokers or intermediaries on placement platforms.","Payments risk: require stringent payment routing and escrow controls to mitigate diversion to unauthorised recipients used by fraudsters.","Training & escalation: implement rapid reporting and escalation protocols for suspicious counterparties, including immediate use of FCA reporting channels."]},{"id":"ec8a6c4152ebb53b5b2b19350cf1dd5c7cf95aee69e411a124c08c424401c624","why":"'Breaks Wealth' clone warning underscores the specific risk of impersonation of authorised firms and appointed representatives — a material threat to delegated authority models in the Lloyd’s market.","bullets":["Delegated authority safeguard: require on‑file evidence of appointed representative status and periodic re‑verification for coverholders, MGAs and delegated brokers.","Digital verification: monitor domain names, email addresses and telephone numbers tied to placing counterparties and suspend electronic acceptance where inconsistencies appear.","Contractual protections: strengthen indemnities, audit rights and immediate suspension clauses in binding authority agreements to limit exposure from clone‑related losses."]},{"id":"b471b0cacd3085b68d22b085ae4d0898c6c182ff3400604c9667df675e784787","why":"OFSI/FCA coordination on cryptoasset abuse raises sanctions, AML and asset recovery risks for global specialty placements that involve crypto exposures or counterparties using crypto rails.","bullets":["Sanctions/AML controls: extend sanctions screening to crypto wallets and counterparties;
