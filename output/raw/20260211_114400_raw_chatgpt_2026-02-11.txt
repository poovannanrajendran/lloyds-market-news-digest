{"executive_summary":"Recent coverage highlights intensifying adoption of AI and combined cyber/tech products, continued emphasis on underwriting discipline, and renewed focus on distribution dynamics and legal risk. For Lloyd’s, syndicates, brokers, MGAs and placement platforms the implications are clear: invest in model governance and capability building, evolve product wordings to reflect converging cyber/AI exposures, and shore up commercial and contractual protections around producer mobility and claims defensibility. Operational priority areas are model oversight, targeted product development, talent retention, data-driven placement workflows and legal/claims readiness.","themes":["AI and model governance in
