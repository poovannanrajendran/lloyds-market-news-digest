{"executive_summary":"Developments this cycle underscore three priorities for Lloyd's, global specialty carriers, brokers, syndicates and placement platforms: (1) capital and capacity reallocation driven by insurer product innovation and targeted capacity increases; (2) continued broker consolidation and performance robustness among major intermediaries shaping placement leverage; and (3) regional expansion and regulatory/technology shifts that affect distribution, data access and claims exposure. Executives should align syndicate appetite, platform connectivity and distribution strategies to market concentration moves, product enhancements and geographically concentrated loss events.","themes":["Broker consolidation and distribution leverage","Capacity reallocation and product innovation","Regional expansion in APAC and domicile relevance","Large-loss events and
