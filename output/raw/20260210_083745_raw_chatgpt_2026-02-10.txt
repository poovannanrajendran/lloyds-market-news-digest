{"executive_summary":"Market signals across Lloyd's, global specialty insurers, brokers, MGAs and placement platforms point to three near-term priorities: (1) strengthen claims and exposure management as Lloyd's elevates claims to a PBO hurdle and fraud/claims discipline tightens; (2) accelerate pragmatic digital and partner integrations while recalibrating expectations after uncertainty around Lloyd's replatforming; and (3) align distribution and capital strategies as strategic investments and leadership hires reshape underwriting, pricing and supply-chain capabilities. For C-suite and consultants this means prioritising claims governance, revisiting placement and payment integrations with fintech and platform partners, hardening model governance for emerging perils and ensuring distribution models (brokers, MGAs, platforms) are structured to capture SME advisory demand and complex global specialty risks.","themes":["Claims governance and regulatory expectations (Lloyd's PBO/hurdle)","Distribution evolution: broker/MGA fintech and premium finance integrations","Market re-platforming and placement platform uncertainty","Capital and ownership changes in global specialty insurers","Exposure management, modelling and emerging perils","Distribution opportunity: SME advice and supply-chain risk solutions"],"items":[{"id":"13171c7c8ac673d3d3582cc2ab67c469a39be4aa5d076327b286d7b43e65fe97","why":"Broker-premium finance integrations are accelerating distribution efficiency and conversion;
