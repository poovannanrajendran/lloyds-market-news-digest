{"executive_summary":"Market activity across Lloyd’s, global specialty brokers, MGAs and placement platforms is accelerating. Key themes include expansion of capacity and product footprints into Lloyd’s (notably Aviva’s HNW launch), MGAs and insurtech-driven modular products targeting SMEs, broker leadership changes that will shape placement strategy, and an elevated focus on M&A and operational integration (claims/legal/insolvency).
