{"executive_summary":"Market signals across the Lloyd's and global specialty ecosystem point to a dual trajectory: continued emphasis on distribution and placement platform expansion to capture regional growth, while capital and pricing dynamics — driven by catastrophe exposures, cyber accumulation and alternative capital vehicles — reshape underwriting strategies. Brokers and placement hubs are accelerating geographies and digital capabilities to preserve speed-to-market and access to capacity. Syndicates and carriers must balance selective underwriting discipline with strategic capital diversification (cat bonds, consortiums, third‑party capital) and invest in technical expertise for emerging lines such as CCS and large-scale cyber. Regulatory, macroeconomic and weather volatility in EMEA, Latin America and North America require coordinated broker-syndicate engagement, refined product wording, and active claims and capital planning.","themes":["Placement platform expansion and hub proliferation (Dubai, Madrid, Miami)","Capital solutions and alternative reinsurance (cat bonds, third‑party capital, consortiums)","Cyber
