{"executive_summary":"Recent FCA activity highlights three priorities for Lloyd’s market stakeholders: a persistent surge in clone and unauthorised firms creating operational, reputational and placement risk for brokers and syndicates; an active regulatory drive toward clearer supervisory communication and innovation testing (notably stablecoin trials) that could reshape payment and collateral flows across specialty lines and placement platforms; and targeted data and cross-sector initiatives that will affect underwriting, premium finance and market conduct. Boards and senior compliance teams should accelerate counter-fraud controls, refresh third‑party due diligence, engage on innovation use-cases (stablecoins and platform settlements) and formalise horizon-scanning for FCA publications and MoUs that influence specialty exposures.","themes":["Clone and unauthorised firm risk — escalation in impersonation scams targeting regulated market
