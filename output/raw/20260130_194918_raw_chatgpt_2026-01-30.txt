{"executive_summary":"Market developments underscore a London and global specialty agenda dominated by placement infrastructure, syndicate capacity shifts, alternative capital growth and broker consolidation. Recent hub openings and placement-hub expansions accelerate access to regional risk flows; Lloyd's syndicates and consortiums are scaling cyber and specialty lines with third‑party capital; cat bonds and multi‑year structures are normalising as program-level reinsurance tools; and broker scale, legal expertise and insurtech M&A are reshaping distribution and transaction execution. For C-suite and consultants the priorities are: secure placement agility, align syndicate product strategies to evolving demand (cyber, CCS, multinational programs), manage capital mix across traditional and market‑linked solutions, and invest in digital trading and legal frameworks to preserve London’s specialty leadership.","themes":["Placement hub expansion and digital
