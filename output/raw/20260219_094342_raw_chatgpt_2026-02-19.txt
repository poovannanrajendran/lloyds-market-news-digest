{"executive_summary":"Recent market signals point to accelerating structural change across global specialty insurance and Lloyd’s-distribution ecosystems. Capital is flowing back into insurtech and platform models, enabling new capacity entrants and digitally enabled placement channels. Broker consolidation and private-equity activity are reshaping distribution leverage. Simultaneously, cyber incident volumes are rising while public transparency is falling, complicating underwriting and claims. Insurer use of AI is materially changing cost bases and claims workflows, with workforce and service-model implications for syndicates and brokers. Niche underwriting opportunities (notably hospitality) and the maturation of runoff specialists offer strategic options to free capital or scale specialty offerings. C-suite priorities should be: reassess distribution and capacity partnerships, accelerate platform and data strategies, harden cyber notification and aggregation analytics, and evaluate runoff/offload options as capital-management tools.","themes":["Insurtech & platform capital","New capacity entrants and international specialty platforms","Broker consolidation and distribution leverage","AI-driven automation, workforce and claims transformation","Cyber risk escalation and notification transparency erosion","Niche underwriting opportunities (hospitality/hotels & motels)","Runoff and legacy liability monetisation","Operational and labour dispute exposures affecting casualty portfolios"],"items":[{"id":"4ed79166f55a89a6bfb11db989f4782fb10a9a9d5fbf93b40c4ba9a0f78324c9","why":"Hospitality is a targeted specialty niche with predictable loss drivers and distribution pathways;
