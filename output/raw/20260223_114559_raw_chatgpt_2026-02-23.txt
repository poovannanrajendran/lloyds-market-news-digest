{"executive_summary":"Market signals emphasise a technology and talent gap across distribution and delegated authority channels, while incumbents replicate MGA models to protect SME and schemes growth. For Lloyd's, global specialty players and placement platforms this translates into concentrated operational risks (under-delivery on digital claims), margin pressure from taxation, and an intensified battle for broker and underwriting talent. Strategic priorities are: validate MGA tech claims, invest in retainable upskilling, price for tax-driven inflation, and accelerate selective platform and scheme digitisation to secure distribution and capacity.", "themes":["MGA digital capability gap and validation","Talent retention and industry-wide upskilling","Tax-driven premium inflation and margin impact","Traditional carriers adopting MGA-style tech and schemes","Broker relationships, placement platforms and delegation risk"], "items":[{"id":"e7d6d5d0d4663de93bb19895e44b63b8b1e4c5b7ca0e0d135634840516e515b0","why":"The article exposes a disconnect between MGAs' marketing and operational technology maturity.
