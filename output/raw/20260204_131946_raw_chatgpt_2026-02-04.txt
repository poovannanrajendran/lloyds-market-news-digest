{"executive_summary":"Q1–2026 movements across reinsurance towers, ILS issuance and manager hiring signal a continued shift of capacity and capital-market discipline into the specialty insurance ecosystem.

Concurrent strength in subordinated insurance debt and operational hiring at boutique ILS managers underscores opportunities — and operational requirements — for syndicates and brokers to leverage capital markets solutions while managing execution and regulatory complexity.","themes":["Capital markets integration into reinsurance placements","Expansion and diversification of ILS investor base","Upper‑layer capacity dynamics and pricing pressure","Operational and governance readiness of ILS managers","Debt issuance as an alternative capital tool"],"items":[{"id":"e1c1a9ab2514cd3c07db2bdc0fe5bfb99332cea3fec692c84c3b4ab73bb98b6c","why":"Selective’s top‑layer expansion and implied room for future cat bonds is a direct example of how primary carriers are reconfiguring reinsurance towers — a dynamic that redistributes demand for upper‑layer capacity and reshapes placement strategies for brokers and syndicates.","bullets":["Placement implication: Brokers should reassess appetite and timing for upper‑layer submissions, balancing traditional treaty placement versus bringing structured ILS alternatives to market.","Capacity & pricing: Meaningful price decreases at renewal indicate softening in certain layers;
