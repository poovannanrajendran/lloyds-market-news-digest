{"executive_summary":"Near-term market dynamics are shaped by intensified physical risk (wildfire and extreme weather), heightened cyber and geopolitical exposures, regulatory and sanctions uncertainty, and continued capital reshaping across specialty re/insurance. For Lloyd's syndicates, brokers and placement platforms, priorities are: recalibrating property and accumulation models, hardening cyber underwriting and policy wordings for nation‑state threats, adjusting capacity and pricing in response to strategic investments and M&A, and accelerating data and distribution integration to preserve competitive advantage.","themes":["Wildfire and property
