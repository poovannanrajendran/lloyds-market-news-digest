{"executive_summary":"Recent market developments underscore three priorities for Lloyd's, global specialty carriers, syndicates and broker networks: strengthening distribution through MGA and coverholder growth; accelerating technology and data investments to speed placement and claims; and aligning capacity strategies with evolving regulatory and climate risk realities. Appointments at placement and underwriting firms, regulatory signals from the FCA, and Lloyd's coverholder approvals point to a market focused on scaling delegated authority, improving placement efficiency and elevating technical capability across borders. Brokers and C-suite leaders should prioritise integration with placement platforms, selective MGA and quota-share partnerships, and targeted investments in analytics and talent to maintain competitive access to specialty capacity.","themes":["Lloyd's distribution expansion and coverholder approvals","MGA-to-syndicate capacity models and quota-share/placement facilities","Technology-led
