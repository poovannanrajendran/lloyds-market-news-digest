{"executive_summary":"The collected coverage signals a pivotal moment for global specialty and the Lloyd’s ecosystem: E&S momentum persists even as casualty shows signs of recalibration, while MGUs, program launches and delegated underwriting are reshaping capacity distribution. Technology, parametric tools and placement platforms are moving from niche to core, and cyber and catastrophe dynamics continue to pressure pricing, modelling and capital allocation. Brokers, syndicates and placement platforms must balance selective growth with disciplined underwriting, expand program and delegated capabilities, and prioritise tech-enabled distribution and risk analytics to capture opportunity and defend margins.","themes":["E&S growth and line expansion","Casualty recalibration and pricing pressure","MGUs, delegated underwriting and third-party
