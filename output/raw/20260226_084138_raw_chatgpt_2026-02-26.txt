{"executive_summary":"Recent market intelligence highlights leadership moves, product innovation, regulatory enforcement and litigation developments that materially affect distribution, capacity and underwriting in the Lloyd's and global specialty arena. Talent migration among brokers and insurers is reshaping relationships with syndicates and reinsurers; parametric and program-based capacity is expanding distribution options; sanctions and compliance incidents are increasing operational risk for marine and P&I placements; and legal and loss-cost trends (cyber, EV recalls, medical cost shifts) are creating immediate contract, pricing and placement implications. Executives should prioritize counterparty mapping, placement platform readiness, legal/wording reviews and targeted engagement with syndicates and MGAs to protect capacity and accelerate client solutions.","themes":["Leadership and broker talent reshaping distribution and leverage","Regulatory and sanctions risk disrupting marine/P&I placements","Parametric and program innovation expanding
