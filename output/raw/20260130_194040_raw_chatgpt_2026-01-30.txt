{"executive_summary":"Recent geopolitical and US domestic developments (homeland security policy, budget impasses, and intensifying Great Power tensions) continue to drive elevated loss potential and compliance complexity for Lloyd's market participants and global specialty brokers. Syndicates must preserve capacity and refine war/political violence and cyber appetites, while brokers and placement platforms should prioritise sanctions screening, delegated authority oversight, and dynamic wordings to reflect interdicted jurisdictions and supply-chain disruption risks. Operational resilience—claims handling during government shutdowns and rapid vetting against evolving US/Russia and Latin America sanctions—remains a near-term priority for C-suite decision-making.","themes":["Geopolitical & war risk exposure","Sanctions and regulatory compliance (US-centric)","Cyber and critical infrastructure vulnerability","Supply-chain and trade disruption","Underwriting syllabi and conditional wordings (war/PV/AVN)","Claims handling & operational resilience during government disruption","Brokers' placement strategy and platform screening enhancements","Capacity management and reinsurance/retrocession impacts"],"items":[{"id":"aed14fd7ada20947721a6989062f9a76381324b7ee30e6c51d9e37cf0b2f6769","why":"Department of Homeland Security developments alter US domestic security posture, critical-infrastructure protections and border controls—areas that influence cyber, aviation, marine and terrorism-related underwriting, together with regulatory expectations for agents and platforms.","bullets":["Underwriting impact: expect revised threat assessments for cyber, aviation and infrastructure clients;
