London Market signal: Fraud vectors and capital shifts are forcing brokers, syndicates and platforms to tighten counterparty checks and rethink placement structures.

Highlights:
1) FCA warning – Strategic Europe Quality Capital (fca.org.uk): A clone of an FCA‑recognised fund; verify FRN and phone the FCA register before any capital introductions.
2) Slide upsizes Purple Re $320m cat bond (artemis.bm): Strong investor demand for large, collateralised named‑storm capacity is lowering pricing and widening structuring options.
3) PERILS estimates Windstorm Goretti insured loss €467m (artemis.bm): A fresh market loss metric to update accumulation models ahead of renewals.

Why it matters: Treat provenance (who you deal with and who’s funding you) as a front‑line risk control, and prepare placement playbooks that combine traditional and alternative capital efficiently.
