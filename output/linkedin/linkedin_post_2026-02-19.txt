Signal from the London Market: Tech, consolidation and fraud risk are forcing faster changes to how we place specialty risk.

Key highlights:
1) J.P. Morgan e‑Trading survey — (e‑trading): Persistent volatility + tech as top market‑structure concern; placement workflows need real‑time data and standardised protocols.
2) TradingHubs warning — (fca.org.uk): Unauthorised introducers remain a material operational risk; validate brokers and lock down premium remittance controls.
3) Sompo to buy Aspen — (reinsurancene.ws): A major capacity re‑balance — brokers should reassess panels and syndicates must clarify value‑add.
4) Experian launches insurance marketplace on ChatGPT — (insurancetimes.co.uk): Conversational distribution is a new front for product exposure and API readiness.

Why it matters: These signals converge — faster electronic placement, stricter counter‑fraud checks and clearer API/data standards are no longer optional if we want efficient distribution and intact capital flows.
