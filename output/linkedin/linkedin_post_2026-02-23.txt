Signal for the London Market: A projected sub‑90% combined ratio for Lloyd’s in 2025 is already reshaping capital allocation, distribution and tech priorities.

Highlights:
1) ICMR: “Lloyd’s CoR below 90% for 2025” — reinsurancene.ws. Why: Stronger returns will drive capital and could prompt rate competition; underwriters must keep discipline.
2) MembersCap tokenises reinsurance on Aptos — artemis.bm. Why: Tokenisation broadens investor access but creates custody, KYC/operational and integration issues for syndicates and platforms.
3) Guidewire survey: Brokers favour digitally advanced carriers — globalreinsurance.com. Why: Carriers with APIs/STP win placement share; integration is now a commercial differentiator.
4) FCA fines influencers over unauthorised promotions — fca.org.uk. Why: Enforcement risk for third‑party marketing means tighter approval, audit and contract controls.

Why it matters: Capital, tech and compliant distribution are the three levers that will determine who wins placement and preserves margins in the next cycle. Read the full digest: https://poovannanrajendran.github.io/lloyds-market-news-digest/digests/digest_2026-02-23.html
