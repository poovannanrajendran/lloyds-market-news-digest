Today's London Market signal: nat-cat losses + fresh ILS/cat‑bond capacity and major M&A are compressing capacity and changing pricing across Lloyd’s placements.

Highlights:
1) Aviva launches HNW business on Lloyd’s (insurancetimes.co.uk) — ramps up competition for private‑client panels and cross‑border capacity.
2) Munich Re’s pandemic consortium with parametric triggers at Lloyd’s (reinsurancene.ws) — faster, objective pay-outs that brokers will lean on for large corporate programmes.
3) Radian completes $1.67bn Inigo buy (reinsurancene.ws) — material capital redeployment into Lloyd’s, reshaping counterparty strength and syndicate competition.
4) FCA warning: VELLUM THISTLE LIMITED (fca.org.uk) — reminder to harden onboarding and premium collection controls for third‑party intermediaries.

Why it matters: re‑test accumulations and retrocession, reprice vulnerable books and embed margin/collateral solutions now — brokers and platforms must be proactive at placement and partner selection.
