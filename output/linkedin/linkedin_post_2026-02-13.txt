London Market signal: Today’s digest highlights where capacity, tech and renewals are converging — worth a quick skim before your next client/placement call.

Highlights to scan in the digest:
1) Renewals focus — rate momentum and lead-line behaviour across casualty and cyber (what underwriters are pushing). 
2) Capacity & reinsurance — signs to watch for changes in retrocession and appetite for US conv cat exposures. 
3) Tech & data pilots — emerging InsurTech/AI trials that could speed claims triage or underwriting insight.
4) Broker/agency movements — appointments, consolidations or MGAs that shift distribution dynamics.

Why it matters: These three areas directly affect pricing, risk selection and broker placement strategy for the coming renewal season — spotting them early keeps you ahead in negotiations.
