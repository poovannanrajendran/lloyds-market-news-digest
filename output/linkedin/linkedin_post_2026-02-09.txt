Today's London Market signal: alternative capital is moving from opportunistic to institutional — cat bonds, sidecars and domicile changes are starting to reshape how syndicates access capacity.

Highlights:
1) Slide targets $250m Purple Re 2026-1 cat bond — artemis.bm. Why it matters: broader named‑storm collateral pushes ILS into territories traditionally held by syndicates.
2) Ark’s Outrigger Re sidecar delivers $45m income — artemis.bm. Why it matters: sidecars are proving predictable returns, a scalable route to add capacity without diluting balance sheets.
3) Malta eases accounting for RSPVs — artemis.bm. Why it matters: improved SPV economics will shift domicile competition and the structure of collateralised reinsurance.
4) FCA warning on Metaminers247 — fca.org.uk. Why it matters: unauthorised intermediaries create real placement and settlement risk; brokers and platforms should verify counterparties.

Why this matters: managing agents, brokers and platforms need to update placement playbooks — think hybrid ILS/traditional structures, stronger counterparty checks and richer exposure data to stay competitive.
