Signal for the London Market: Governance shake‑up meets payment‑route and distribution risks — time to harden onboarding, payments and claims.

Highlights
- Lloyd’s council changes — globalreinsurance.com: Luck named senior independent director; council reshuffle that will accelerate governance and market reform, with implications for syndicate conduct, capital and platform interoperability.
- FCA warning on unauthorised FX (Alisa FX) — fca.org.uk: A clear premium/payment diversion exposure; validate payment flows, require authorised counterparties and embed FCA Warning List checks into onboarding.
- Claims capability = MGA profitability lever — insurancetimes.co.uk: Invest in end‑to‑end claims analytics and surface claims KPIs in capacity agreements to protect margins in a soft market.
- Parametric scaling opportunity — globalreinsurance.com: CelsiusPro growth shows demand for satellite‑triggered products; platforms must support triggers, index data and fast settlement workflows.

Why it matters: Combined, these items raise the bar on counterparty due‑diligence, premium routing controls and operational readiness — practical priorities for brokers, MGAs, syndicates and placement platforms today.
