Today’s London Market signal: alternative capital, product innovation and capital-efficient access are moving from “trend” to business model.

Highlights:
1) Argenta Private Capital & Helios launch “Lloyd’s Starter Homes” — artemis.bm
   Why it matters: lowers investor entry thresholds; brokers and placement platforms must add these vehicles to capital-advice playbooks.
2) Selective ups its top layer to $1.5bn — artemis.bm
   Why it matters: creates room for cat‑bond/ILS placements and shifts reinsurance topology for excess layers.
3) Aon on cyber fines widening the gap between regulatory risk and insurance — reinsurancene.ws
   Why it matters: requires jurisdictional wordings, sub‑limits and product innovation to preserve insurability.
4) Winter Storm Fern modelled losses c.$6.7bn — globalreinsurance.com / insurancejournal.com
   Why it matters: re-run accumulations, rethink retrocession and prepare facultative sourcing fast.

Why it matters: if you place or underwrite specialty risk, integrate ILS channels, tighten cyber wordings and stress‑test accumulations now — not at renewal.
