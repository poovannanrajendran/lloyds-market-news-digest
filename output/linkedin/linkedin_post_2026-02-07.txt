Today’s signal for the London Market: infrastructure, payments and open‑banking governance are about to reshape placement and settlement workflows.

Highlights:
1) Lloyd’s re‑platforming announced (theinsurer.com) — impacts syndicate migration plans, data governance and binding authority continuity; start migration and SLA contingency planning now.
2) Gemini Payments UK exit (fca.org.uk) — potential premium/collateral disruptions where crypto/e‑money rails are used; inventory PSPs, notify clients and secure authorised alternatives.
3) FCA independent assessment for a Future Entity (fca.org.uk) — standardised open‑banking APIs will change KYC, payment initiation and data portability; engage with trade bodies and invest in API‑capable architecture.

Why it matters: these items combine operational risk (migration + third‑party dependency) with payment continuity and regulatory change — get contingency plans, treasury controls and an API roadmap in place.
