London Market signal: The 12 Feb 2026 public digest is live — it’s a raw, link-led compilation with no editorial summary, so you can triage sources directly.

Highlights:
1) No executive summary or curated key themes — the page delivers unedited headlines and source domains for 2026-02-12.
2) Source domains are shown alongside items, so you can quickly assess provenance before briefing underwriters or clients.
3) Timestamped archive entry — useful for audit trails, morning brief decks and compliance checks.

Why it matters: A non‑editorial digest removes interpretation bias and speeds up frontline decision-making — especially when you need to verify a story or escalate to claims/compliance fast.
