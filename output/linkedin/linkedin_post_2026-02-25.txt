Signal from the London Market: Access to intelligence and identity controls are now as material as capacity — they shape placement speed, delegated authority risk and pricing.

Highlights:
1) Specialist complex risk MGA approved as Lloyd’s Europe coverholder (insurancetimes.co.uk) — onshore EEA access; syndicates should reassess delegated-authority oversight and reporting.
2) FCA warning on a ‘Fixed Income’ impersonation (fca.org.uk) — reinforces need for payment-routing controls, domain vigilance and mandatory regulatory checks before transfers.
3) Global property rates down ~9% (Marsh / artemis.bm) — soft market pressure; prioritise risk selection and analytics to protect margin.
4) $260m Integrity Re III cat bond (artemis.bm) — ILS appetite remains strong; integrate capital‑markets options into placement strategies.

Why it matters: These items tie together distribution, tech and capital — from SSO/market‑intel access to delegated authorities and alternative capacity — all of which affect how quickly and safely we place specialty risk.
