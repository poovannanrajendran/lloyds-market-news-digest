Signal from the London Market: Lloyd’s digital programme pause, updated default mechanics and big capital moves mean brokers, syndicates and platforms need to pick priorities now — not later.

1) Blueprint Two shelved (globalreinsurance.com) — stalls market-wide standardisation; accelerate interim API/EDI fixes and bilateral SLAs to avoid placement friction.  
2) LMA updates Lloyd’s Open Form Default Agreement (theinsurer.com) — recheck default/recovery language in subscription docs and platform contract templates.  
3) Onex buys 63% of Convex; AIG takes ~35% (globalreinsurance.com) — fresh capital that will shift capacity and competitive dynamics for complex specialty placements.  
4) MS Amlin hires senior head of exposure management (globalreinsurance.com/theinsurer.com) — expect tighter analytics-driven submission standards and aggregation controls.

Why it matters: These are operational and capital signals — they change how we submit, price and secure capacity. If you run placements or underwrite, focus on interoperability, revised contract mechanics and analytics-ready submissions.
