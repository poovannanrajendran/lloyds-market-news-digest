Market signal: Payments, placement speed and capital supply are forcing immediate operational priorities across the London Market.

Highlights
1) Payments Forward Plan (fca.org.uk) — the FCA roadmap means platforms must map new rails, tighten settlement controls and automate reconciliations.
2) QBE lowers catastrophe retentions (artemis.bm) — lower attachment points free capital and change broker placement strategy.
3) Munich Re slashes retrocession & sidecars (artemis.bm) — reduced retro supply accelerates demand for ILS, subordinated debt and bespoke solutions.
4) Gallagher Re APAC reshuffle (globalreinsurance.com) — leadership continuity preserves access to Lloyd’s capacity in APAC.

Why it matters: Faster settlement expectations, tougher onboarding and shifting reinsurance supply mean brokers, syndicates and platforms should prioritise KYC, API connectivity and alternative-capital options now.
