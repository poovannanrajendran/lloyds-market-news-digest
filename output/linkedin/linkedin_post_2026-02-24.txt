Signal for the London Market: Lookalike sites, tokenised capital and a major capacity shift are changing how we place and price specialty risk.

Highlights:
1) FCA warning — “Compare Bonds Today” (comparebonds.today): Unauthorised lookalike risks premium diversion and brand misuse — tighten intermediary validation and premium escrow controls.
2) Sompo to buy Aspen for $3.5bn: Expect material shifts in Lloyd’s-access capacity and redistribution of global specialty appetite — brokers should re‑evaluate panel strategies.
3) MembersCap launches tokenised ILS on Aptos: Tokenisation can broaden investor access and create new liquidity pathways — assess custody, KYC/AML and platform integrations.
4) Early AI-related claims while wordings lag: Syndicates and brokers must clarify AI exposures in endorsements now, not later.

Why it matters: These developments affect where premium flows, who holds risk and how we document exposures — operational, regulatory and reputational consequences for syndicates, MGAs and placement platforms.
