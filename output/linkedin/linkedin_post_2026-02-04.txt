Today's London Market signal: regulators are tightening the gates while actively courting scale‑ups — a squeeze that matters for brokers, syndicates and placement platforms.

Highlights:
1) Nexco Assets — fca.org.uk — FCA warning: immediate reminder to tighten onboarding and counterparty screening for third‑party platforms and non‑standard intermediaries.
2) Scale‑up Unit joins — fca.org.uk — bespoke regulatory engagement for high‑growth insurtechs; prepare governance packs if you plan to partner or scale.
3) Winter Storm Fern loss estimates — globalreinsurance.com — $4–6.7bn: reassess freeze accumulation, attachment layers and claims triage.
4) Zurich’s bid for Beazley — businessinsurance.com — consolidation risk: revisit broker panels and contingency plans for capacity concentration.

Why it matters: Distribution, capacity and catastrophe exposures are converging with tech and regulatory pressure — now’s the time to tighten onboarding, platform governance and reinsurance/placement playbooks.
