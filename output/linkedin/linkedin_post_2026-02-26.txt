London Market signal: Distribution is shifting — Bermuda hires, MGA-led PVT and marine mutual growth are already changing how specialty capacity is accessed.

Top highlights:
1) Price Forbes appoints Davies as Bermuda head of property — globalreinsurance.com
   Why it matters: Strengthens the Bermuda–Lloyd’s bridge for complex offshore property placements.
2) HIVE launches political violence & terrorism via an MGA with digital placement — globalreinsurance.com
   Why it matters: Delegated authority + digital workflows speed binding; syndicates must test governance before providing capacity.
3) Skuld posts 6% P&I tonnage growth at 2026/27 renewal — globalreinsurance.com
   Why it matters: Mutuals are taking quality marine tonnage, forcing syndicates to differentiate on service and appetite.
4) Allstate places $1.2bn via Sanders Re cat bonds — artemis.bm
   Why it matters: Large sponsor ILS deals require broker/platform operational scale and strategic choices on collateralised participation.

Why it matters: Collectively these stories point to redistributed placement routes and capital — brokers should map offshore and delegated channels; syndicates must tighten governance, platform integration and appetite settings. If you place or underwrite specialty risk, platform readiness will decide who wins the flow.
