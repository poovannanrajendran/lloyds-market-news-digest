Quiet signal from the London Market today — the 1 March 2026 public digest flagged nothing urgent.

Highlights:
1) Executive summary: 0 highlights selected for 2026-03-01 — no items met the alert threshold.
2) Key themes: None identified — the digest did not surface any sector-wide drivers.
3) Story cards: N/A — no third‑party articles or “why it matters” notes were flagged.

Why it matters: A blank digest can be useful — it buys time to focus on underwriting reviews, client engagements and pipeline work rather than reacting to market shocks. Treat today as an opportunity to tidy data, revisit exposure assumptions and check workflows.
