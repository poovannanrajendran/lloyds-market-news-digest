London Market signal: ILS and specialty capital are clearly maturing — tokenisation, daily cat‑bond pricing and reinsurer‑sponsored vehicles are changing where and how capacity shows up.

Highlights:
1) Oxbridge Re — artemis.bm: Tokenised reinsurance sidecars (20–42% targets) — broadens investor access but raises KYC, custody and legal integration questions.
2) Siena Capital — artemis.bm: Plan for daily cat‑bond pricing — better liquidity and price discovery will shift issuance timing and secondary market dynamics.
3) Hannover Re — artemis.bm: Sponsored Bermuda ILS vehicle — reinsurer‑sponsored capacity can compete with syndicates and alter placement strategies.
4) FCA warning (Gold Forex) — fca.org.uk: One reminder to tighten distributor/integration screening to limit AML, operational and reputational spillovers.

Why it matters: Brokers, syndicates and placement platforms must update placement playbooks — think investor onboarding, legal/AML controls and execution timing — to protect margins and preserve access to capital.
