It’s a critical reminder for market participants conducting KYC and client diligence, as these entities often operate with professional-looking fronts. For managing agents, brokers, and their clients, verifying FCA authorisation status is a non-negotiable first step that this warning vividly highlights.</div><ul><li>Unauthorised Entity Risk: Acts as a market-wide risk alert, highlighting entities that sidestep FCA’s oversight and capital adequacy requirements, posing a direct stability threat.</li>
<li>Heightened Due Diligence: Reinforces the necessity for robust, ongoing due diligence for brokers, MGAs, and syndicates when evaluating new capacity or partnerships.</li>
<li>Client and Market Education: Serves as a tool for brokers and advisors, underscoring the importance of verifying FCA authorisation and steering clients away from unregulated entities, preserving market integrity and consumer trust.</li></ul></article>

Recurring appearances of such firms on the FCA register indicate the systemic risk posed by fraudulent schemes impersonating legitimate services.
