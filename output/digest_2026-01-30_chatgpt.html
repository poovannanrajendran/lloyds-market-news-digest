For Lloyd’s market participants this raises immediate client protection, AML/KYC and platform screening priorities.</div><ul><li>Immediate risk: Clients transacting with unauthorised entities lose access to the Financial Ombudsman Service and FSCS protections, increasing potential for client losses and claims directed at brokers or syndicates that facilitated introductions.</li>
<li>Controls to implement: Enhance real‑time screening of counterparties and intermediaries against FCA Warning List feeds, strengthen KYC/AML checks on new digital introducers and implement transaction red‑flags on placement platforms.</li>
<li>Strategic actions: Update broker onboarding policies, incorporate automated blocklists into placement workflows, and communicate enhanced due‑diligence requirements to global broker networks and MGAs to preserve market reputation.</li></ul></article>

<li>Controls to implement: Enforce multi‑factor verification for new capacity introductions, require corporate documentation and regulatory verification for inbound digital leads, and integrate automated URL and domain monitoring into vendor risk processes.</li>
<li>Strategic actions: Coordinate with placement platforms to mandate FCA status checks before accepting new trading counterparties, run periodic audits of introduced business, and escalate suspicious cases to market compliance and the FCA.</li></ul></article>

Lloyd’s brokers and syndicates must treat such warnings as indicators to harden digital intake and marketing channels.</div><ul><li>Immediate risk: Targeting of retail or institutional clients through digital campaigns can generate regulatory inquiries, client remediation costs and reputational harm that spills over to sponsoring brokers and syndicates.</li>
<li>Controls to implement: Strengthen digital marketing governance, require proof of regulated status for referral partners, and deploy anomaly detection to flag unusual client acquisition patterns on placement platforms.</li>
<li>Strategic actions: Institute a central market registry of suspicious domains and phishing patterns to be shared among Lloyd’s brokers and syndicates, and run targeted training for distribution teams on identifying unauthorised counterparties.</li></ul></article>

<li>Governance requirements: Ensure model validation, explainability, bias testing and human oversight are integrated into live testing plans; prepare impact assessments and operational runbooks that align with FCA expectations.</li>
<li>Recommended engagement: Consider applying to AI Live Testing for material AI initiatives (underwriting/pricing or placement automation), allocate cross‑functional teams (risk, compliance, IT, operations) and coordinate with placement platform partners to test end‑to‑end controls under regulatory supervision.</li></ul></article>
