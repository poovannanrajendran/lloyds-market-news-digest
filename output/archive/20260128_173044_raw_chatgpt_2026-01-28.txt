{"executive_summary":"2025–2026 market signals confirm that insurance-linked securities (ILS), parametric solutions and alternative capital are now core components of global specialty risk transfer. Record catastrophe bond issuance, expanding ILS manager AUM, and domicile/regulatory moves in Bermuda (including a proposed Parametric SPI class) are reshaping placement economics and structuring choices for brokers, syndicates and Lloyd’s participants. Simultaneously, primary insurers and reinsurers are layering traditional treaty programs with market-sourced lower layers and cat bonds, while potential strategic M&A in specialty lines (Zurich/Beazley) could reconfigure cyber and third‑party capital dynamics. Executive priorities: (1) accelerate parametric and ILS capability across placement platforms and syndicates; (2) refresh domicile and SPV playbooks to leverage Bermuda PSPI momentum; (3) maintain underwriting and capital discipline to defend returns and client outcomes amid increasing investor capital and market consolidation risk.","themes":["ILS and catastrophe bonds matured into mainstream
