<li>Recommended action: Syndicates should evaluate establishment or representative relationships within GIFT City; brokers should develop specialised placements and local compliance workflows.</li>
<li>Risk/opportunity: Opportunity to capture premium growth in South Asia with regulatory benefits; risk around operational set-up, local market nuances and regulatory change.</li></ul></article>

<li>Mitigation: Rapidly verify counterparties against the FCA Register, strengthen client onboarding/KYC checks and publish clear client advisories across broker and platform channels to reduce successful fraud attempts.</li>
<li>Operational change: Enhance platform access controls, email-safety and domain-monitoring (typo-squatting detection) and integrate FCA warning feeds into compliance surveillance to flag interactions with unauthorised entities.</li></ul></article>

<li>Mitigation: Reconfirm the provenance of new digital distribution partners and marketplace participants, and require evidence of authorisation for any firm presenting advisory or arrange/placement services.</li>
<li>Strategic implication: Incorporate vendor and intermediary vetting into placement-platform onboarding and trading workflows; consider legal clauses that reduce exposure if counterparties are later found unauthorised.</li></ul></article>

<li>Mitigation: Communicate proactively with corporate clients and wholesale brokers about FCA warnings, reinforce verification steps before wiring funds and centralise incident response for suspected fraud reports.</li>
<li>Market conduct: Maintain active cooperation with FCA alerts and industry fraud intelligence; syndicates and managing agents should brief distribution partners on indicators of impersonation and scam narratives.</li></ul></article>

<li>Governance: Establish pre-test model inventories, documented risk assessments and explainability metrics so participation demonstrates robust model governance to regulators and clients.</li>
<li>Execution: Identify high-value, low-risk pilots (eg. non-core lines, reinsurance placement support), secure cross-functional sponsorship (CRO, CTO, legal), and engage early with the FCA and technical partners to accelerate safe market adoption.</li></ul></article>
