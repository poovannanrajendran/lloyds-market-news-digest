        <div class="summary">Market signals from recent Artemis reporting underscore a dual market dynamic for 2026: robust investor demand and structural growth in ILS (both public and private) alongside conventional reinsurance price softening. Third‑party capital is consolidating as a permanent, cross‑class source of capacity, while Bermuda ILS platforms and senior hires sharpen distribution and modelling capabilities.

For Lloyd’s brokers, syndicates and placement platforms this highlights the risk of client and distribution-channel confusion, potential unauthorised introductions and exposure to fraud losses or reputational harm.</div><ul><li>Immediate review of intermediary verification: require FCA registration checks, written confirmation of regulated status and recordable proof for all new digital introducers and marketplace partners.</li>
<li>Strengthen placement and binding authority clauses to explicitly exclude business originated via unauthorised platforms; add audit rights and digital provenance requirements.</li>
<li>Market outreach and client education: coordinate broker notices and syndicate advisories explaining how to verify authorised providers and the lack of FSCS/FOS protections for deals with unauthorised firms.</li></ul></article>

For specialty insurers and brokers, these schemes can generate fraudulent exposures, incorrect risk aggregation and AML/KYC blindspots that undermine syndicate underwriting discipline.</div><ul><li>Tighten KYC/AML for new business sources: require enhanced due diligence for leads sourced via crypto-adjacent or non-traditional online channels and block onboarding where regulatory status is unclear.</li>
<li>Integrate digital-monitoring signals into enterprise risk platforms: use domain watchlists, FCA warning feeds and broker intel to proactively block transactions linked to flagged entities.</li>
<li>Escalate suspicious activity quickly: ensure broking desks and platform operations have clear escalation pathways to compliance, syndicate security teams and Lloyd’s market policing units.</li></ul></article>

<li>Review cyber and financial lines wording: confirm exclusions and aggregations consider risks from pseudo-investment schemes and list unauthorised-provider scenarios to limit unintended coverage.</li>
<li>Broker and platform governance: require due diligence attestations from digital distribution partners and include termination rights where partners are added to regulator warning lists.</li></ul></article>

For Lloyd’s syndicates, global specialty brokers and placement platforms this is a strategic opportunity to validate AI-driven underwriting, pricing, placement automation and fraud detection under regulatory scrutiny.</div><ul><li>Consider cohort participation for mature POCs: syndicates and platform vendors should evaluate AI Live Testing to demonstrate model governance, fairness and operational controls ahead of full deployment.</li>
<li>Design tests to match commercial KPIs and controls: set clear measures for underwriting accuracy, speed-to-bind, escalation rules and human-in-the-loop safeguards; capture audit trails and model explainability outputs.</li>
<li>Formalise model risk and data governance: use learnings to codify data lineage, third-party model vetting, post-deployment monitoring and compliance reporting aligned with FCA expectations.</li></ul></article>
