{"executive_summary":"Recent headlines across regional politics, geopolitical hotspots, migration, public disorder and emerging infectious disease underscore concentrated tail risks for the Lloyd’s market and global specialty insurers. Underwriters and brokers should prioritise political violence and war/no-war capacity, pandemic and pandemic-exclusion clarity, cyber and crime exposure monitoring, and offshore/marine underwriting discipline. Placement platforms and syndicates must refresh scenario testing, client advisory materials and treaty language to reflect elevated regional and systemic exposures.","themes":["Geopolitical & political violence risk","Energy and offshore infrastructure exposure","Pandemic and emerging infectious disease risk","Migration and humanitarian liability exposures","Domestic civil unrest & public entity risk","Cybercrime, fraud and operational resilience","Tourism, travel and regional supply-chain disruption"],"items":[{"id":"5961e03342cf4491ba6c73aef38dfbfdf338f5071f0d3272f9ee36cad594bccc","why":"State-level political developments in Minnesota signal localised regulatory change and potential for civil unrest that can drive elevated public-entity, liability and event-related claims.","bullets":["Assess exposure to municipal and public-entity liability, including policing and social-inflation impacts on claims costs.","Advise clients on D&O and public sector wording changes;
