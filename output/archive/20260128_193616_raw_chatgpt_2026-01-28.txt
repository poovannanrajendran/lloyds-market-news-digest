{"executive_summary":"Recent Artemis reporting highlights active capital markets issuance in catastrophe bonds, growing ILS manager capacity, and evolving investor appetite for longer‑tailed risks — all of which materially affect Lloyd’s syndicates, global specialty carriers, brokers and placement platforms. Concurrently, digital, IP and contact‑protection controls on trade press sites underscore operational and regulatory considerations for client outreach, content syndication and vendor due diligence. Executives should prioritise placement timing, capital allocation to casualty ILS, and compliance of marketing and data‑sharing practices.","themes":["ILS and cat bond issuance dynamics","Investor
