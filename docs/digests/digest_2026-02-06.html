        <div class="summary">Market signals through early‑2026 indicate a continued shift of specialty risk capacity toward alternative capital (ILS, third‑party vehicles and parametric propositions) even as traditional reinsurance pricing softens. Catastrophe model updates and event loss estimates (eg, winter storm Fern) will drive short‑term reinstatements and shape renewal negotiations, while stable cat‑bond yields and rapid AUM growth in dedicated vehicles expand capacity options for syndicates and brokers.

<li>Mandate multi-factor verification for any change in bank account or premium routing instructions and route suspicious details through compliance and Lloyd&#39;s market security teams.</li>

Such actors increase the risk of non-recoverable losses, lack of access to FSCS/FOS protections for clients, and operational interruptions for placement platforms that inadvertently distribute their offerings.</div><ul><li>Strengthen onboarding: require evidence of FCA authorisation or equivalent home-state regulator confirmation for all new wholesale partners and distribution intermediaries.</li>
<li>Implement mandatory clause checks and contract validation to ensure placements are only accepted from authorised entities; suspend business flows pending verification.</li>
<li>Coordinate with prime brokers and reinsurers to establish shared blacklists and real-time alerting for suspected unauthorised firms targeting the specialty market.</li></ul></article>
